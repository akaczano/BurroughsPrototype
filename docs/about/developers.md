# Developers
### Jason Cao
**Purdue Email**: cao216@purdue.edu <br />
My responsibility as part of the Viasat team on the Burroughs Project is to add new features and implement improvements in Aidan's initial version of Burroughs.  As the time of writing, I have mostly completed the code for issue #14, which is to add Debug Levels to allow users to view information about how the SQL query is being  processed.  The other issue that I am working on is issue #7, which is to support windowing functions to allow users to read data from specific rows. 
### Aneesh Chakravarthula
**Purdue Email**:  chakra55@purdue.edu <br />
My role in the Burroughs project is to fix issues and help improve the code in the initial version of Burroughs made by Aidan. So far, my contribution on the team is issue #14, which was to add debugLevels for more output. This is seen as necessary to help the user get more information regarding the processes being done and the variables that were being used. 
### Vandana Chari
**Purdue Email**: chariv@purdue.edu <br />
As part of the Viasat team, my task is to further develop and improve Aidan's initial version of Burroughs. So far, I have contributed to the self-join issue (#26). To implement this functionality, I have rewritten self joins to join with a duplicated version of the topic. Ultimately, Burroughs should be able to support it because it is crucial to reference data within a table in order to make comparisons. 

### Erika Ergart
**Purdue Email**: eergart@purdue.edu <br />
As a part of the Viasat team, my job is to facilitate improvement of the Burrough's initial version. The issue that I worked on (#3) deals with the select and where clause of date-field conversion from a string representation of a SQL's to kSQL's languages. 

### Aidan Kaczanowski
**Purdue Email**: akaczano@purdue.edu <br />
As the Peer Mentor for the Viasat team, it is my job to both lead the development work and assist the students in anyway I can. I wrote the initial version of Burroughs including all of the base functionality for the CLI, producers, and processing of basic queries. I have worked on many issues since then, some of which include the addition of common table expressions (#12), support for the `group_concat` function (#8), and the creation of the Burroughs Web UI (#6). 

### Wyatt Klueber
**Purdue Email**: wklueber@purdue.edu <br />
As a member of the team, I worked on issue (#16), which allowed the user to read Burroughs and SQL commands from files through burroughs. Secondly, I worked on issue (#10), which enabled Burroughs to always know the data type of a query's group by. Currently I am working on issue (#5), which will allow the use of cascading aggregations in Burroughs.

### Mihira Krishnaswamy
**Purdue Email**: krish134@purdue.edu <br />
As a part of the Viasat team, it is my job to help improve upon Aidan's initial version of Burroughs. So far, I have contributed to  the where clause date-field issue (#3), which deals with a necessary string to date conversion and where clause recursion so that the sql to ksql translation of queries containing dates works as expected and dates aren't compared lexographically.

### Andrew Riordan
**Purdue Email**: riordana@purdue.edu <br />
I worked on issue numbers 2,9,15,26. My contributions to Burroughs included adding some non-query functionality to Burroughs, (topic deletion) and dealing with complexities arising from join statement(s). These make Burroughs more useful to an end user.  

### Ainesh Sootha
**Purdue Email**: asootha@purdue.edu <br />
I worked on issue (#16), which dealt with reading Burroughs commands and SQL queries from files, which made running the first set of commands easier and quicker for the end user. I also worked on (#10) - determining the data type of the group by field in the query, and (am currently working on) (#5) - adding support for multiple group byâ€™s (Cascading aggregations).
